## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](/assets/IMG_1718.jpeg)

I served as a TA in the GenCyber cybersecurity program, where we encountered the task of automating escape room lighting. To address this challenge, I developed a Python script that effectively utilized the WLED platform to establish communication with Wi-Fi-enabled ESP8266 modules and LED strips. Through this solution, we achieved seamless control over the escape room lighting, creating an immersive experience for participants while showcasing the practical implementation of IoT devices.

Through this project, I gained extensive knowledge and hands-on experience in establishing seamless communication between Wi-Fi-enabled ESP8266 modules and LED strips. The development of a Python script allowed me to harness the capabilities of the WLED library, enabling precise control and automation of the escape room's lighting system. This immersive project deepened my understanding of IoT protocols and the practical applications of programming in the context of IoT-enabled devices.

## Issues

During the project, I faced the challenge of managing multiple LED strips, each connected to its ESP8266 controller. Although each controller could handle up to 750 lights, it still posed difficulties in individually controlling lighting in separate rooms. To address this, I manually divided each LED strip into smaller segments and adjusted the Python script accordingly. By doing so, I achieved precise control over each segment, creating synchronized and tailored lighting effects in different parts of the escape room.
